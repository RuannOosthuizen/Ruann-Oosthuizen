                <p class="my-story">
                    Hi! I'm Ruann Oosthuizen. I'm currently a Web Developer and Administrative Coordinator at OpsFi and Digital Asset Studios. As a proud South African living in the beautiful city of Cape Town, I am a passionate video-maker, film enthusiast, web developer, and software engineer as well as a HUGE nerd and Star Wars fanatic. My designs and creations are neat, dynamic, and impactful, leaving a lasting impression.
                    I love to tell stories and share laughs, whether through video-making, photography, or the intricate world of coding and I thrive on the opertuinity to talk about Star Wars lore. As a fast learner, I eagerly dive into new subjects that pique my interest, continuously expanding my skills to enhance my creative and technical work.
                    My love for the creative world has taken me to incredible places and shown me the limitless possibilities of what I can create. This journey has motivated me to develop my own unique style and narrative, which I am excited to share and explore with others.
